so every c code has to have a header file/ or a library that
that lets us do all the stuff we want to do in a code, such as input output
and we dont have to write the code for everything. It gives us acess to reusing functions
and premade for our convinience

another good practise to use is >>>using namespace std
this saves us the hassle off std::cout<<

all C programs must have a int main(){}
int is the return type of this function
main is the name (this is mandatory and predifined in this case but we can have our own custom functions)
and it's content is written inside{}

we declare variables and all after specifying their data types and use cin>> or cout<< to obtain
or display them.

Each Cpp statement has to end with a semi colon, it's just syntax and shows when one line or command of action has ended

Also must add return 0 to the end of the program.

Also you can add comments using double slash //
or mass comment using /*

Also its nice to end cout<< with endl cuz it sends the output cursor to the next line making wtv ur printing more readable
